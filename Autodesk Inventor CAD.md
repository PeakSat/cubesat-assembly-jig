# Autodesk Inventor CAD File
The original assembly was created using Autodesk Inventor Professional 2024.3. For the best compatibility, it is recommended to use the same version or a later release of the software.

Due to its large size, the Inventor CAD file has been uploaded to PeakSat's Google Drive. You can access it via the following path: [Spacedot_Assembly_JIG.iam](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17NNdx__LoRzcGLzc4SJA5yJfDK3orKRx)
